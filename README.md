# Flora-Keeper ðŸŒº
A guide for taking care and watering your house plants.

## Background
This is an iOS app I made for a course.
The app is meant to help track data on your houseplants.
It also gives info on how much light and water a plant needs.

Built using XCode, Swift, and the recently introduced SwiftUI.

Below are a few pictures of the app as well as wireframe plans.
